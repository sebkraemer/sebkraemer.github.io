You are reading my blog, that's great! What is this blog about? *(For the TL;DR,
just scroll to the end.)*

# About TL;DR dev blog

Today's blogosphere, free and commercial MOOC learning platforms offer a massive
often deliver high quality articles, tutorials, videos or whole projects for you
to learn about your core technology or new topics. Keeping up is nontrivial. And
let's not forget about podcasts.

In my daily routine, I often wished to have more time to listen any of the many
podcasts. Listening to dev talks during commute (on my bicycle) didn't quite
work for me. To really get the content, I might have to pause and replay a
section, want to take notes to get back to specific points later. Video playback
speed can only be increased so much without losing the context at some point and
the same problems I'm having with the podcasts arise.

For me, there's always more intersting things to bookmark than I can swallow in
the time I have. Sounds familiar? Wouldn't it be great to have some resource
that would deliver a short but concise recap of the content? Something that's
technical enough to grasp the core ideas and contributions but so short you can
get it in minutes rather than hours. *(I found it funny that at a similar time a
now [very successful startup](https://www.blinkist.com/) came around with the same
idea applied to books!)* Something that gives you an informed idea and lets you
decide if it's worth your time or not to visit the original source. I like
articles that give me a *TL;DR* at some point to let me decide exactly this.

And then there's the following aspect: I heard it, read it, watched it. What
then? What did I really get out of it? It's no secret that new knowledge settles
much better if applied in a context, be it writing or teaching about it or
building something. You will instantly notice gaps. Then you revisit, ask, try
something, play, digest. *That's* when you learn.

Its name, *TL;DR dev blog*, stems from the idea to write short articles for
anywone interested in reading my short version of some content but -- more
importantly -- for me to revisit topics and work on them.

I didn't come very far with that yet, only one episode of one of my favorite C++
sources, [C++
weekly](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLs3KjaCtOwSZ2tbuV1hx8Xz-rFZTan2J1).
As I feared, writing a TL;DR about the episode opened new questions and took
much longer than anticipated. But in the end [it was
done](../posts/cppweekly-ep154-reduce-code-bloat). I found the experience useful
and will try to continue. Even if it takes precious time that's missing for
consuming other things.

The main reason I only did one post about C++ weekly is that I started a web
development project shortly after initiating this blog. I'm doing this to learn
JavaScript and related topics which I currently prioritize over C++. Being
primarily C++ developer with love for backend and cloud technologies, this seems
to be a logical step for me. There's no point in denying that JavaScript is the
language of the web. I'll be blogging about it to revisit what I did (and
challenge it) and to inform the interested reader about what the project is
about, what decisions are made at certain steps and explain technicalities.

# The TL;DR

- I often wished for a good resource to write the useful essence (for me) of an
  interesting article or video to save my time. This ~~is~~ was the core idea of
  the blog.
- Writing my own articles shall improve my understanding of the topic.
- I also hope it will improve my technical writing skills.
- Diverging from the original idea, I'm now also writing about my project(s)
  that, like the TL;DR-ing, I do to improve my skills.
- I'm glad you're here! Feel free to contact me per
